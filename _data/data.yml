    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I like testing things, to find weak spots and unusual patterns. Which makes me a good quality assurance specialist.
      I like to learn new things.
      I have a classic IT education: I know algorithms, data structures, programming concepts. I'm aware that I don't know everything about programming, but I know how to learn it the fastest way.
      I write clean code. I always assume that somebody will work with it in the future, so I'm trying to make it clean, simple, and readable.
